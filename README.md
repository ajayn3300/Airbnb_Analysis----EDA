What Airbnb is?
#Airbnb, Inc. is an American company that operates an online marketplace for lodging, primarily homestays for vacation rentals, and tourism activities.  It allows property owners to list their place as holiday accommodation or for lodging and allows travelers to find a place to stay while they are away from home.
(Dataset is based in New York City)

Primary Goal: The main objective of this exploratory data analysis project is to understand the Airbnb customer's priority and selection criteria for choosing a room type present in a particular neighborhood group of New York City and analyze the behavior of the hosts.

Solution: 
1. Analyzing and Exploring the Dataset
2. Importing libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Folium (geospatial visualization)
3. Data Wrangling: removal, replacement, and fixing the invalid data, missing values, and outliers (extreme values)
4. Data Visualization: With the help of libraries like matplotlib and seaborn we plot graphs from the data (cleaned) given.
5. Observing and Taking out Conclusions from the graphs and plots.

Conclusions:
a. Rewarding the active hosts will push other hosts to perform well
b. Despite being more expensive people opt for the rooms they are comfortable with.
c. For customers privacy and comfortability is the first priority over than prices of the rooms in a particular area.
 

Result: - So like this, we can make good conclusions which can help the company and hosts to perform well and improve the customer experience for the development of everyone.
